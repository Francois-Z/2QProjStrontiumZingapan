		<h6>The Scadrial Shards and the Metallic Arts:</h6>
		<p>Scadrial is a planet from the fantasy universe, the Cosmere. This planet is very similar to our own after the Catacendre, 
		which marked the merging of Ruin and Preservation. Before this major event took place, however, the planet's features were quite different. 
		Mists appear during the night, shrouding only the unempowered eyes, and the frequent ashfalls covered the red sky. 
		All this changed after the Catacendre, except for the mists. <br><br>
		
		There are two gods that made and inhabit Scadrial; however, they are not called gods, but Shards, as they were part of the power of creation. 
		A person who takes or holds the power or "Investiture" of a Shard is called a vessel, a mind to control it. Preservation and Ruin are polar 
		opposites to each other, so much so that having these two Shards "touch" each other would hurt both of the vessels.</p>

			<h1>Preservation</h1>
			<p>One of these shards is "Preservation," associated with the color white. Leras originally held the power of Preservation, 
			but had since given it away after his death. The Terris Religion calls the Shard <i>Terr</i> 'to preserve' while the Southern Scadrians 
			refer to it as <i>Frue</i>. Of which, the latter is both the spouse and sister of <i>Herr</i> (see Ruin); thus forming the Jaggenmire.</p>
		</article> <br>
		<article>
			<h1>Intents</h1>
			<p>Together, Preservation and Ruin created Scadrial, from its geography to its orbit. However, Preservation seeks to preserve, to avoid harm 
			by avoiding change. This is important to know, for Preservation is not inherently good, as said by Ruin. "If he had his way, you'd all be 
			frozen in time, unable to act lest you harm one another." </p>
		</article> <br>
		<article>
			<h1>Metallic Art: Allomancy</h1>
			<p>Allomancy is an end-positive art, where an allomancer gets power from an external source.
			Here, Preservation itself fuels allomancy. Allomancers "burn" metal in their stomach to 
			trigger an effect, which depends on what metal is being burned. Note, however, metals are 
			not necessarily Investiture; metals "connect" to Preservation's Investiture.<br><br>
			
			An allomancer can burn either only one type of metal or all metals. The former we call a 
			Misting and the latter a Mistborn. An allomancer can enhance the effects from a metal if they 
			"flare" it, consequently exhausting it faster.</p>

		<!--Content-->
		<article>
			<h1>Ruin</h1>
			<p>One of these shards is "Ruin," associated with the color black. Ati held the power of Ruin, 
			but, similar to Leras, gave it away, ending the Catacendre. According to the Southern 
			Scadrians, they call the Shard Herr, the husband and brother of Frue (see Preservation); 
			thus forming the Jaggenmire.</p>
		</article> <br>
		<article>
			<h1>Intents</h1>
			<p>Together, Preservation and Ruin created Scadrial, from its geography to its orbit. As 
			opposed to its other half, Ruin seeks to destroy, to harm. However, this is not inherently bad, 
			as without Ruin, there will be no change, and change always brings death. "Death is 
			necessary. Every clock must wind down, every day must end. Without me, there is no life, 
			and never could have been. Life is change, and I represent that change."</p>
		</article> <br>
		<article>
			<h1>Metallic Art: Hemalurgy</h1>
			<p>Hemalurgy is a fairly complicated art. First, it is end-negative as it usually loses power 
			because of the law of Hemalurgic Decay. It states that a hemalurgic spike loses power if it is 
			outside a body, but one can "trick" the spike by setting it inside blood or a slab of meat. <br><br>

			This brings me to the second feature: Hemalurgy can steal powers or characteristics from an 
			individual using metallic spikes, which we call a hemalurgic spike. To do this, one must first 
			pierce the victim with a metallic spike, often killing them, then pierce it once more in 
			someone else to grant them the power.</p>

	<!--Harmony-->

		<article>
			<h1>Harmony</h1>
			<p>After the death of the two vessels of the Shards in the Catacendre, Sazed took both powers 
			to form Harmony. This event is the very first instance of the intermingling of two Shards by 
			one vessel. Where Preservation can hear people's thoughts and Ruin can speak to people, 
			Harmony can form a two-way communication with an individual, given a hemalurgic spike 
			has pierced them.</p>
		</article> <br>
		<article>
			<h1>Intents</h1>
			<p>After Sazed took the two powers, he restructured Scadrial, from its people to its orbit, to its 
			form before the Lord Ruler changed it. Harmony can create and seeks to develop the world 
			further, but it cannot heavily favor either of the two powers.</p>
		</article> <br>
		<article>
			<h1>Feruchemy</h1>
			<p>Feruchemy has long existed before the Catacendre and even the rule of the Lord Ruler. 
			Feruchemy is an end-neutral art formed by both Preservation and Ruin. A feruchemist 
			cannot lose or gain power practicing this art; they store power, therefore changing the time 
			they use this power. A feruchemist can either only store power in one type of metal or all of 
			it. The former we call a Ferring and the latter a Full Feruchemist.<br><br>

			They store this Investiture by investing or "filling" a metalmind, then accessing or "tapping" it 
			for later. Unlike an allomancer who gets a fixed amount of power, a feruchemist can tap 
			more power by exhausting the reserve quicker. This means that they are not limited to fixed 
			amounts of power and therefore can overpower an allomancer.</p>
