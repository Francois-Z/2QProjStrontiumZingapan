			<h1>Preservation</h1>
			<p>Like any others, Preservation is a Shard of Adonalsium inhabiting Scadrial alongside Ruin. Its former vessel was Leras,
			but has long been held by Kelsier and Vin after his death. Currently, Harmony holds the power of Preservation intertwined with
			the power of Ruin. The Terris religion calls Preservation <i>Terr</i> 'to preserve' while the Southern Scadrians refer to it as 
			<i>Frue</i> and is believed to be feminine.</p>
		</div> <br>
		<div>
			<h2>Intents</h2>
			<p>Preservation seeks to preserve the world by never causing harm to its inhabitants so much so that it would freeze it, and as such,
			Preservation is not inherently good. This is hinted by Ruin's quote on Preservation, "If he had his way you'd all be frozen in time, 
			unable to act lest you harm one another." It cannot destroy, for it will cause harm to the vessel even if it were to preserve in the long run.</p>
		</div> <br>
		<div>
			<h1>Magics</h1>
			<h2>Metallic Art: Allomancy</h2>
			<p>Allomancy is an end-positive magic where power is obtained by an external source, which in this case, is the power (body) of Preservation itself.
			This power is inherited instead of gained (there is an exception, however, which is consuming Lerasium). Allomancers come in two types, a misting
			who is capable of <i>burning</i> one metal and a mistborn who is capable of <i>burning</i> all of them. However, for one to use allomancy, 
			an allomancer must first <i>snap</i> or awaken to their powers, which usually happens in traumatic experiences. <i>Burning</i> is a process where an Allomancer
			can use up his metal reserves (in his stomach) for magical effects, but do take note that metals are not manifestations of power itself; instead,
			it is used to channel in Preservation's power. Now, flaring is a process similar to burning but uses the metal faster for a slightly more powerful effect.
			Effects differ with each metal such as <i>burning</i> iron, which allows a coinshot or mistborn to pull metals toward his/her center of gravity. <br><br>
			
			There exists 16 base metals, divided into four: Physical, which alters physical attributes, Mental, which affects emotional and supernatural senses, Temporal, 
			which affects the passage of time, and Enhancement, which affects other allomantic processes. Shardic metals are metals that directly derive from a Shard; 
			Currently, these metals are Lerasium, Atium, Harmonium, and Trellium. These and their alloys (with a soft exception on Trellium) can be burned by some 
			Allomancers or used as Metalminds or Hemalurgic spikes.</p>
		</div> <br>
		<div>
			<h2>Mists</h2>
			<p>Mists are the gaseous form of Preservation's Investiture (or power). The vessel can program the mists to do certain things such as <i>snapping</i>
			Allomancers, as what Leras did, for them to awaken to their powers or to come out in certain times, locally, as what Sazed did when he took in the
			power. Up until Sazed transcended to harmony, the mists were used for the former, to <i>snap</i> Allomancers. Mists can be used to fuel an Allomancer of choice's
			Allomancy enhancing them and circumventing the need for metal reserves.</p>
		</div> <br>
		<div>
			
		</div>
		<div>
			<h2>Direct Interventions</h2>
			<p>A vessel wielding Preservation's power is able to manipulate the planet, its geology, its lifeforms, and even its orbit. This is due to preservation
			having directly created Scadrial alongside Ruin. Preservation is mostly invested in Scadrians, so it is possible for the vessel of that Shard to alter
			bodily functions and attributes. Preservation can hear individuals' thoughts, but cannot speak to them; this is only possible with Ruin's power.</p>
		</div> <br>
		<div class="feruchemy">
			<h2>Feruchemy</h2>
			<p>Feruchemy is an end-neutral art from Ruin and Preservation where a Feruchemist can store Investiture in a metalmind for use later. There is 
			no power lost nor gained, the time it is used just differs. A Feruchemist that can use one metal is called a Ferring while someone who can 
			utilize all of them is named a full Feruchemist. Like Allomancy, the attribute stored in a metalmind differs depending on the metal used 
			like steel storing speed. It is to note that storing in a metalmind weakens the corresponding attribute, but tapping, the term used for taking 
			in the power of a metalmind, strenghthens that attribute. Say, a steelrunner can store speed for 30 minutes and be half as slow for that timeframe, 
			but can tap speed for 30 minutes to be half as fast in that timeframe. However, unlike Allomancy where the output of power remains mostly constant, 
			a Feruchemist can tap more intensely, magnifying the effect of the tap, in which case the power stored within runs out proportionally faster. <br><br>
			
			A twinborn (a misting and ferring hybrid) of the same metal can <i>compound</i> a metal, enhancing the effect of the metal by tenfold, such as gold compounding
			yields a near-invincibility for the compounder when tapping and burning gold. However, for twinborns with different metals, there exists something called a
			resonance, which is an added effect from a combination of feruchemical and allomantic (and rarely hemalurgic) powers.<br><br>
			
			Likewise to Allomancy, the 16 base metals are the same, but metalminds out of these metals store (mostly) very different from allomantic attributes. It is also
			divided into four, Physical, which stores physical attributes, Cognitive, which stores cognitive attributes such as mental speed or memories, Hybrid, which affects
			bodily functions such as hunger and warmth, and lastly, Spiritual, which stores attributes of the soul. <br><br>
			
			Feruchemy is also inherited, but was only exclusive to the Terris people before the Catacendre as the Lord Ruler forced Terris people to only breed
			within themselves and not with other races.</p>

			<h1>Ruin</h1>
			<p>Ruin is a Shard of Adolnasium residing in Scadrial alongside Preservation. It is also known as <i>Herr</i> from the Souther Scadrians.
			Its former vessel, now deceased, was Ati, but is now held by Sazed as Harmony, intertwined with the power of Preservation. Unlike the white Investiture
			of Preservation, Ruin's is typically black.</p>
		</div> <br>
		<div>
			<h2>Intents</h2>
			<p>Ruin seeks change, to age and decay, a contrast to Preservation. Like Preservation, it is not inherently evil for the lack of change means that there
			can never be life. The Shard would have been a much more destructive force instead of slow decay if not for Ati and his nature.</p>
		</div> <br>
		<div>
			<h1>Magics</h1>
			<h2>Metallic Art: Hemalurgy</h2>
			<p>Hemalurgy is an art where a Hemalurgist can steal or add an attribute by piercing another individual with a metal in a specific point with full <i>Intent</i> to do so.
			This works by stealing a part of a person's spiritweb by piercing and ripping out the Hemalurgic spike then adding it to the recipient's Spiritual DNA by also
			piercing it into the recipient. Different bind points require different metals which also affect what attribute is stolen and added. This causes 'holes' to be present
			in an individual, giving a way for Shards or powerful enough Soothers or Rioters to control these spiked individuals. Any form of Investiture in the Cosmere can be stolen by a Hemalurgist. <br><br>
			
			This is considered an end-negative art because of the Law of Hemalurgic Decay, stating that Hemalurgic spikes outside a body will lose its charge, but not completely.
			However, it can be 'tricked' into thinking it is in a body by encasing it blood or a large enough slab of meat. Alternatively, it can be encased in aluminium.<br><br>
			
			There are various creatures made with Hemalurgic Spikes. One of these are Inquisitors, who are priests of the Lord Ruler, pierced with nine to eleven spikes, 
			both Allomantically and Feruchemically charged. They see the spikes pierced into their eyes, where vision is replaced with allomantic iron and steel sight.
